# vfire-less-pc-spread-chance
How it works:
There are 3 multipliers which all are convars, meaning this mod edit is custom and can be effectively disabled.
vfire_pc_spread_base (0.8) : This is the base rate fire will spread to any players. 20% is not a huge reduction, but there's a slight difference and the other multipliers are far greater.
vfire_pc_spread_onfire (0.5) : The rate fire will spread to a player if they are already on fire. This makes the fire more lenient without being too generous.
vfire_pc_spread_self (0.0) : The rate fire on the player another part of the player. I recommend extremely low values if you change this, otherwise it's possible you'll just burn to death like you would in vanilla.

I will not be updating this because i plan on working more on vFire and making my own addon which includes this, also if vFire updates this might break, maybe i'll do something about it but no promises
